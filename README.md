Development of a Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Algorithm using Deep Learning Techniques
Real-time vehicle trajectory prediction in the CARLA simulator using classical kinematic equations and deep learning models.
This project forms the practical and experimental core of my diploma thesis, aiming to compare physics-based and deep learning-based methods for forecasting vehicle motion in a simulated urban environment.

📌 Introduction & Motivation
Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is a crucial component in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It enables:

Collision avoidance and path planning.

Cooperative maneuvers between autonomous and human-driven vehicles.

Traffic flow optimization and safety enhancement.

However, predicting motion in dynamic, multi-agent environments presents challenges such as:

Complex interactions between road users.

Uncertainty in driver behavior.

Limited or noisy perception data.

This project addresses these challenges by evaluating two contrasting approaches within a controlled simulation environment.

📖 Project Overview
The project compares:

Deep Learning Approach – Using the CRAT-Pred neural network model, trained on the Argoverse Motion Forecasting v1.1 dataset, capable of multi-agent, multi-modal trajectory prediction.

Classical Kinematics Approach – Applying deterministic motion equations based on velocity, yaw, and elapsed time to estimate future positions.

All experiments were conducted in the CARLA Simulator, an open-source platform for autonomous driving research, allowing reproducible and high-fidelity urban traffic scenarios.

⚙️ System Architecture / Workflow
Pipeline:

Data Collection from CARLA – Track ego and NPC vehicles in real-time.

Preprocessing – Compute displacements, normalize orientation via rotation matrices.

Prediction

CRAT-Pred Model – LSTM encoder + Graph Neural Network + Multi-Head Attention + Residual Decoder for 60 future points (3s horizon).

Kinematics – Predict positions using classical motion equations.

Post-Processing & Visualization – Inverse rotation, CARLA in-simulator rendering, and matplotlib plotting.

Evaluation – Calculate metrics:

ADE (Average Displacement Error)

FDE (Final Displacement Error – CRAT-Pred only)

MR (Miss Rate)
